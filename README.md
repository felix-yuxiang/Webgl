# Armadillo with with Coronavirus

### (Ice-cream with red virus popping up)

- I load the virus object with objectloader and mtlloader for the texture mapping. Plus, I use some scaling animations to make it more interesting.

- 'W' and 'S' control the translation of armadillo along z axis (move forward and backward).

- 'A' and 'D' rotates the armadillo left and right respectively above the pelvis.

- 'Q' and 'E' makes the armadillo lean forward and backward respectively.

- 'Z' and 'C' control the translation of armadillo along x axis (left and right respectively).
